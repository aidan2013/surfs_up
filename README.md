## Summary

- At face value, it appears June and December temperature does not have a significant difference variance which implies the ice cream shop business may be sustainable year round. However, if we plot a histogram for the June and December temperatures, we can see that June has a bellcurve but the december data is a little more random. The Mid-70 temperatures have a significantly higher count than the rest of the temperature ranges.
